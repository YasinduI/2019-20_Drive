FTCLib is the FTC library to end all libraries. By porting features from wpilib for FRC, FTCLib makes the use of advanced systems extremely easy for even rookie programmers. This wiki will teach you how to use the library and what each class means and represents.

FTCLib documentation - <https://ftclib.gitbook.io/ftclib>

## How to use developer release
Add this to your build.common.gradle:
```groovy
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
```  
Now, in your TeamCode buid.gradle, add these lines:
```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.arcrobotics:ftclib:2.0.12' // Replace 2.0.12 with the latest release
}
```
And that's it! (May need to follow installation instructions below, however

## Legality for competition use

This is the second official release of FTCLib! The project is still in the Alpha stage, with many things being untested. The project is being added to constantly, and there will most likely be smaller updates to come in the near future. If you want to contribute to the project, be sure to read the [Contributing.MD](https://github.com/FTCLib/FTCLib-1/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md)

There is still a great need for Alpha testers, so also please contact us if you are interested in that.

# Attention Users!
This library uses Java 8! If you do not already have Java 8 on your FTC Project, please do so! If you do not know how to, read further. __Doing this__ *will* __require all other devices to delete and then reclone the project following the change!__ You get weird Android Studio errors other wise. To change, go to the `build.common.gradle` and find the lines that say

```groovy
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_7
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_7
    }
```

Change the `7` to an `8` and then perform a Gradle Sync. You now have Java 8 (and all the things that come with it)!

## Installation

1. Open up your FTC SDK Project in Android Studio.

2. Go to your `build.common.gradle` file in your project.

    ![BuildCommonGradle](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EasyOpenCV/blob/master/doc/images/build-common-gradle.png)
    
3. Add the following to the `repositories` section at the bottom of the file.

   ```groovy
   jcenter()
   ```
    
4. Open the `build.gradle` file in your TeamCode module. 
    
    ![TeamCodeGradle](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EasyOpenCV/blob/master/doc/images/teamcode-gradle.png)
    
5. Go to the bottom of the file, and add the following.

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
        implementation 'com.arcrobotics:ftclib:2.0.11'
    }
    ```
6. Because FTCLib makes use of advanced features, you need to increase the minSdkVersion to 24. Unfortunately, this means that ZTE  Speed Phones are not supported in this release.

In build.common.gradle, change the minSdkVersion from 19 to 24:
```groovy

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId 'com.qualcomm.ftcrobotcontroller'
        minSdkVersion 24
        targetSdkVersion 26
```
    
7. Perform a gradle sync to implement your changes.

    ![GradleSync](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EasyOpenCV/blob/master/doc/images/gradle-sync.png)


__NOTE:__ If your module has a few dependencies, you might have an error related to multidex on building the project.
This is caused by the project exceeding the limit for imports enforced by Android Studio. To solve this, 
add `multiDexEnabled true` to the below location inside the `build.common.gradle` file.

```groovy

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId 'com.qualcomm.ftcrobotcontroller'
        minSdkVersion 24
        targetSdkVersion 26


        multiDexEnabled true
```

## Welcome to FTCLib!

Thank you for using the FTCLib library for your code! All of the people who worked on it have put a lot of effort into making FTCLib an amazing library. We thank you for putting our effort to work with your own projects. We hope you have great luck and success with your programming.

The mission of FTCLib is briefly summarized in the following quote made by Jackson from ARC Robotics, who started the library.


> Our goal is to make programming easier and more efficient through effective classes and detailed examples of implementation. - Jackson ARC Robotics

## Usage

For drivetrain kinematics, you can do:
```java
MecanumDrive dt = new MecanumDrive(motors);

x = gp1.joyLeft.x;
y = gp1.joyLeft.y;
turn = gp1.joyRight.x;

dt.driveRobotCentric(x, y, turn);
```
For a simple CV example that find skystone using built-in detector:
```java
import com.arcrobotics.ftclib.command.CommandOpMode;
import com.arcrobotics.ftclib.vision.SkystoneDetector;

import org.openftc.easyopencv.OpenCvCamera;
import org.openftc.easyopencv.OpenCvCameraFactory;
import org.openftc.easyopencv.OpenCvCameraRotation;
import org.openftc.easyopencv.OpenCvInternalCamera;

// You don't need CommandOpMode, LinearOpMode, and other OpModes work well
public class SkystoneSample extends CommandOpMode {

    OpenCvCamera camera;
    SkystoneDetector pipeline;
    @Override
    public void initialize() {

        int cameraMonitorViewId = hardwareMap.appContext.getResources().getIdentifier("cameraMonitorViewId", "id", hardwareMap.appContext.getPackageName());
        camera = OpenCvCameraFactory.getInstance().createInternalCamera(OpenCvInternalCamera.CameraDirection.BACK, cameraMonitorViewId);
        camera.openCameraDevice();

        pipeline = new SkystoneDetector();

        camera.setPipeline(pipeline);
        camera.startStreaming(640, 480, OpenCvCameraRotation.UPRIGHT);
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Assuming threaded. It hopefully found the skystone at the end of init.
        SkystoneDetector.SkystonePosition position = pipeline.getSkystonePosition();

        switch (position) {
            case LEFT_STONE:
                break;
            case CENTER_STONE:
                break;
            case RIGHT_STONE:
                break;
            default:
                break;
        }
    }
}
